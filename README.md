## üíª About the project

Recreate the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) interface as a way of learning and training skills using TypeScript, React and CSS. During the construction of this project this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBweoUiMsDg&ab_channel=BoniekyLacerda) was used as support material.

All catalog data such as title, description, cover, background photo and rating were extracted using the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

### Functionalities

- [x] **Spinning Loading**: Effect when bringing data from API.

- [x] **Featured Catalog**: Select a catalog at random and display it on the home page.

- [x] **Sessions Listing**: When consuming the API, separate the catalogs into sessions.

- [x] **Menu Effect**: Create an effect on the menu background according to the user's screen scroll.

- [x] **Catalog Card**: Display a card with the catalog details when hovering over the cover.

- [x] **Carousel Listing**: Present control buttons to manipulate the visualization of session items.

- [ ] **Infinite Listing**: When reaching the end of the list of catalogs, the same items from the beginning must be presented.
